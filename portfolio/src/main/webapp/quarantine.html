      <h1>Just Quarantine Things</h1>

      <p>These are some things I've gotten into/enjoyed during quarantine:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Working out</li><br>
            <li>Baking (but from the box lol)</li><br>
            <li>Skincare (I recommend The Ordinary)</li><br>
            <li>Watching bad movies on Netflix with friends</li><br>
            <li>Getting a succulent (super easy to take care of omg it's insane)</li><br>
            <li>Getting those cheesy dorm lights because why not</li>
        </ul> 

      <p>I've also definately spent more time on the internet during the 
          beginning of quarantine. I found some interesting quarantine statistics 
          displayed in the graph below. It shows the percent change in user time 
          spent online in different industries, from tourism to supermarket websites.
