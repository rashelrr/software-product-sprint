      <h1>Rashel's Portfolio</h1>
      <p> Hi! My name is Rashel Rojas and I am first-generation student majoring in 
        computer science at Columbia University. What got me into CS was a beginner's 
        JavaScript class in middle school and it became something that I am passionate
        about. I hope to use my skills in CS to eventually work at a company working on 
        environmental and sustainability projects. </p>

        <p> A little about me: I'm Ecuadorian, I love working out, and I am so 
        excited to a part of SPS! </p>
